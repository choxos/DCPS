# **Abstract**

**Background:** Clinical trials are fundamental to advancing medical knowledge and improving patient care. However, incomplete or delayed dissemination of trial findings leads to research waste, ethical concerns, and undermines participants’ contributions. While global regulatory frameworks mandate registration and timely reporting in official registries like ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, significant non-compliance persists. In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) serves as the primary funding body for clinical research, with explicit policies emphasizing transparency and responsible research conduct.

**Objective:** This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the completeness and timeliness of result reporting from NHMRC-funded clinical trials conducted between 2013-2023. Additionally, we seek to identify institutional and geographical factors associated with reporting compliance to inform targeted improvement strategies.

**Methodology:** We will conduct a systematic analysis of NHMRC-funded grants awarded between 2013-2023 to identify all funded clinical trials. Comprehensive data extraction will utilize multiple sources, including Grants.gov.au, Research Data Australia, and three clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ANZCTR.org, and AustralianClinicalTrials.gov.au). Publication outcomes will be assessed through systematic searches in scientific databases (PubMed) and general search engines (Google, Google Scholar). Our analysis will assess five key metrics: (1) proportion of trials reporting results within two years of completion; (2) proportion reporting results or summaries within one year; (3) proportion with no results reported; (4) median time to results reporting; and (5) institutional and geographical variations in reporting compliance. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses will identify factors associated with reporting timeliness.

# **Introduction**

Dental caries remains one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases globally, affecting individuals across the lifespan and imposing substantial health and economic burdens on healthcare systems (Kassebaum et al., 2017; Peres et al., 2019). In Canada, despite advancements in dental care and public health interventions, dental caries continues to be a significant public health challenge with disparities across geographic regions, socioeconomic groups, and demographic strata (Canadian Health Measures Survey, 2007-2009, 2009-2011).

The decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT/dmft) index serves as the primary epidemiological indicator for measuring dental caries burden. However, comprehensive trend analysis of DMFT/dmft at national and subnational levels in Canada remains limited, particularly for projections beyond current data. Previous studies have examined caries prevalence in specific populations or regions (Naidu et al., 2016; Amin, 2011), but a systematic nationwide analysis using advanced statistical methods is needed to inform evidence-based policy decisions and oral health interventions.

Recent methodological advancements in disease mapping and temporal trend analysis have employed Bayesian hierarchical models to address limitations in traditional epidemiological approaches (Blangiardo & Cameletti, 2015). Bayesian methods offer distinct advantages for dental caries modeling by:

1. Incorporating parameter uncertainty through full posterior distributions (Gelman et al., 2013\)

2. Integrating multiple levels of data hierarchy (individual, regional, provincial)

3. Modeling complex spatiotemporal dependencies (Besag et al., 1991; Knorr-Held, 2000\)

4. Handling data sparsity through borrowing strength across spatial and temporal domains (Bernardinelli et al., 1995\)

5. Accommodating non-normal distributions typical of count data like DMFT/dmft (Lawson, 2013\)

Similar Bayesian approaches have been successfully implemented in modeling other health conditions in Canada (Lix et al., 2018\) and dental caries internationally (Farzadfar et al., 2023; Shoaee et al., 2022). Notably, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has employed comparable methods for global and regional estimation of oral health metrics (Kassebaum et al., 2017; Bernabe et al., 2020).

This protocol details a comprehensive methodological framework for analyzing DMFT/dmft trends in Canada from 1990 to 2025 and projecting patterns to 2050 using Bayesian hierarchical models. By adapting and enhancing the spatiotemporal modeling approaches used in previous studies (Shoaee et al., 2023), we aim to generate robust estimates that account for Canada's unique geographic, demographic, and healthcare system characteristics.

4.1 Bayesian Hierarchical Framework

The analysis will employ a comprehensive Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate DMFT/dmft indices across Canada at national and subnational levels. Bayesian statistics provides a natural framework for this analysis by treating parameters as random variables with probability distributions rather than fixed values. This approach allows for the formal incorporation of prior knowledge, natural representation of uncertainty, and flexible modeling of complex dependencies across spatial, temporal, and demographic dimensions.

The hierarchical structure of the model reflects the inherent nested nature of the data: individuals within age groups, within geographic regions, within time periods. This structure facilitates "borrowing strength" across different units, which is particularly valuable for areas with sparse data. For instance, estimates for a province with limited observations can be improved by incorporating information from neighboring provinces or from the same province in adjacent time periods.

For DMFT/dmft data, which follows a count distribution with overdispersion relative to the Poisson distribution, we will employ a negative binomial likelihood. This distribution appropriately accommodates the variance structure typically observed in dental caries data, where the variance exceeds the mean. The negative binomial distribution can be parameterized in terms of its mean (μ) and dispersion parameter (r), with larger values of r indicating less overdispersion.

4.2 Model Specification

The core model structure begins with the specification of the likelihood function. For each observation indexed by age group (k), sex (l), province (i), and year (j), the DMFT/dmft count is modeled as:

DMFT\_ijkl \~ NegativeBinomial(μ\_ijkl, r)

where μ\_ijkl represents the expected DMFT/dmft count and r is the dispersion parameter. For interpretability and to ensure non-negative predicted values, we model the logarithm of the expected count using a linear predictor that incorporates fixed effects, random effects, and structured interactions:

log(μ\_ijkl) \= α \+ X\_ijkl'β \+ S\_i \+ T\_j \+ A\_k \+ G\_l \+ (ST)\_ij \+ (SA)\_ik \+ (TA)\_jk \+ ε\_ijkl

In this equation, α represents the global intercept, which can be interpreted as the baseline log-expected DMFT/dmft when all other factors are at reference levels. The term X\_ijkl'β represents the contribution of covariates, where X\_ijkl is a vector of predictor variables and β is the corresponding vector of fixed effect coefficients. These covariates include socioeconomic indicators (e.g., educational attainment, income levels), environmental factors (e.g., water fluoridation status), healthcare system characteristics (e.g., dentist-to-population ratio), and demographic variables (e.g., urbanicity index).

The terms S\_i, T\_j, A\_k, and G\_l represent random effects for spatial (province/territory), temporal (year), age group, and sex dimensions, respectively. These random effects capture systematic variation beyond what is explained by the measured covariates. The interaction terms (ST)\_ij, (SA)\_ik, and (TA)\_jk model the dependencies between spatial-temporal, spatial-age, and temporal-age dimensions, allowing for differential temporal trends across provinces and age groups. Finally, ε\_ijkl represents the residual error term, capturing unexplained variation.

4.3 Spatial Component Specification

The spatial random effect S\_i is crucial for modeling geographic patterns in dental caries. We will employ the Besag-York-Mollié (BYM2) model, which decomposes the spatial effect into structured and unstructured components. This parameterization is particularly advantageous for capturing both smooth spatial patterns and location-specific heterogeneity.

The BYM2 specification can be written as:

S\_i \= √τ\_S(√ρ\_S u\_i \+ √(1-ρ\_S) v\_i)

where τ\_S is the overall spatial precision parameter (inverse of variance), ρ\_S is a mixing parameter between 0 and 1 that determines the proportion of the spatial variance attributable to the structured component, u\_i is the spatially structured component, and v\_i is the unstructured component.

The spatially structured component u\_i follows an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) prior distribution, which induces spatial smoothing based on adjacency relationships between provinces and territories. For any province i, the conditional distribution of u\_i given all other provinces (u\_{-i}) is:

u\_i|u\_{-i} \~ Normal(1/n\_i ∑\_{j∈δ\_i} u\_j, 1/(n\_i τ\_u))

where δ\_i represents the set of neighbors of province i, n\_i is the number of these neighbors, and τ\_u is a precision parameter. This formulation implies that, conditionally, the expected value of u\_i is the average of its neighboring values. Provinces sharing borders will have more similar values, reflecting the spatial autocorrelation typically observed in health outcomes.

The unstructured component v\_i follows an independent normal distribution:

v\_i \~ Normal(0, τ\_v^{-1})

where τ\_v is a precision parameter. This component captures province-specific variations that are not explained by the spatial structure.

The BYM2 parameterization improves over the original BYM model by addressing identifiability issues and making the parameters more interpretable. The mixing parameter ρ\_S has a direct interpretation as the proportion of the marginal variance explained by the structured component, facilitating prior specification.

For the Canadian context, the neighborhood structure will be defined based on geographic adjacency, with provinces and territories considered neighbors if they share a land border. Special consideration will be given to maritime connections, particularly for insular regions such as Newfoundland and Labrador.

4.4 Temporal Component Specification

The temporal random effect T\_j captures trends and fluctuations in dental caries over time. To model the temporal evolution, we will employ a second-order random walk (RW2) prior, which provides flexibility while encouraging smoothness in the time trend. This prior is particularly suitable for health metrics that typically exhibit gradual rather than abrupt changes over time.

The RW2 prior for the temporal effect can be formulated as:

T\_j|T\_{j-1},T\_{j-2} \~ Normal(2T\_{j-1} \- T\_{j-2}, τ\_T^{-1})

where τ\_T is the precision parameter controlling the smoothness of the temporal trend. This formulation implies that the expected value of T\_j is a linear extrapolation from the two previous time points, with deviations from this expectation controlled by the precision parameter. Higher values of τ\_T result in smoother temporal trends.

The RW2 prior effectively penalizes deviations from a linear trend, which aligns with the typically gradual changes observed in population-level dental health indicators. For the beginning of the time series (j=1,2), appropriate constraints or modified priors will be implemented to ensure identifiability.

4.5 Age and Sex Components Specification

The age group random effect A\_k captures systematic variations across different age cohorts. Given that dental caries follows distinctive age patterns, with dmft relevant for deciduous teeth in younger ages and DMFT for permanent teeth across the lifespan, we will model the age effect using a first-order random walk (RW1) prior:

A\_k|A\_{k-1} \~ Normal(A\_{k-1}, τ\_A^{-1})

This prior encourages smoothness in the age profile while allowing for flexibility to capture age-specific patterns. The precision parameter τ\_A controls the degree of smoothing, with higher values resulting in more similar effects for adjacent age groups.

For the sex effect G\_l, given that there are only two categories (male and female), we will use an independent and identically distributed (IID) prior:

G\_l \~ Normal(0, τ\_G^{-1})

where τ\_G is the precision parameter. This formulation allows for differences in dental caries burden between males and females, which is important given the documented sex disparities in oral health outcomes.

4.6 Interaction Terms Specification

The interaction terms in the model are crucial for capturing differential patterns across combinations of dimensions. For the space-time interaction (ST)\_ij, we will employ a Type I interaction as defined by Knorr-Held (2000), which assumes that the spatial and temporal main effects are independent:

(ST)ij \~ Normal(0, τ{ST}^{-1})

This specification allows for province-specific temporal trends in dental caries, accounting for differential impacts of oral health policies, socioeconomic changes, and healthcare system developments across provinces over time.

Similarly, the space-age interaction (SA)\_ik captures province-specific age patterns:

(SA)ik \~ Normal(0, τ{SA}^{-1})

This interaction is particularly important for modeling regional variations in age-specific dental caries patterns, which may be influenced by factors such as school-based dental programs, cultural practices affecting oral hygiene in different age groups, and region-specific dietary habits.

The time-age interaction (TA)\_jk models changes in age patterns over time:

(TA)jk \~ Normal(0, τ{TA}^{-1})

This term captures cohort effects and temporal changes in age-specific risk factors, such as evolving dietary patterns, changes in oral hygiene practices across generations, and the differential impact of oral health interventions on various age groups over time.

For all interaction terms, appropriate constraints will be implemented to ensure identifiability of the model.

4.7 Prior Specifications

The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for all model parameters. These priors should be informative enough to stabilize the estimation while not overly influencing the posterior when substantial data are available. For the fixed effects, we will employ weakly informative normal priors:

α \~ Normal(0, 10\)

β\_m \~ Normal(0, 1\) for each covariate m

These priors provide regularization while allowing the data to dominate when sufficient information is available. The relatively diffuse prior for the intercept (α) reflects greater uncertainty in the baseline level, while the more concentrated priors for the covariate effects (β\_m) represent a reasonable range of effect sizes on the log scale.

For precision parameters, we will use penalized complexity (PC) priors as proposed by Simpson et al. (2017). PC priors are designed to penalize complexity in the model, with the prior distribution constructed to favor simpler models unless the data provide evidence for more complex structures. For the precision parameters associated with random effects, the PC prior can be expressed as:

p(τ\_^{-1/2}) ∝ λ\_ exp(-λ\_\* τ\_\*^{-1/2})

where λ\_\* is a parameter that controls the concentration of the prior. This specification places more prior mass on higher precision values (lower variances), thus favoring smoother patterns unless the data suggest otherwise.

For the mixing parameter ρ\_S in the BYM2 model, we will use a Beta prior:

ρ\_S \~ Beta(0.5, 0.5)

This prior is symmetric around 0.5, indicating no a priori preference for either the structured or unstructured component in the spatial random effect.

For the dispersion parameter r of the negative binomial distribution, we will use a Gamma prior:

r \~ Gamma(0.01, 0.01)

This diffuse prior places minimal constraints on the overdispersion parameter, allowing the data to determine the appropriate level of dispersion.

All prior specifications will be subjected to sensitivity analyses to assess their impact on the posterior distributions, ensuring robust inference.

4.8 Model Implementation

The implementation of the Bayesian hierarchical model will utilize the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) methodology, which offers computational advantages over traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for latent Gaussian models. INLA provides accurate approximations to the posterior distributions of model parameters with substantially reduced computational time, which is particularly advantageous for complex spatiotemporal models with large datasets.

The primary implementation will be conducted using the R-INLA package, which offers efficient computation of Bayesian hierarchical models with structured additive predictors. The package provides functionality for specifying complex random effect structures, including the BYM2 model for spatial effects and various random walk models for temporal and age effects.

The model fitting process will begin with data preparation, including the creation of the necessary adjacency matrix for the spatial component and the structuring of interaction indices. The model formula will be specified to include all fixed effects, random effects, and interaction terms. The negative binomial family will be used for the likelihood, with parameters estimated through the INLA approximation.

For computational efficiency, we will implement a parallel processing approach for model fitting, utilizing high-performance computing resources when available. The model will be fit in stages, starting with simpler structures and progressively incorporating more complex components, to ensure stability in the estimation process.

As an alternative implementation, particularly for model components not readily available in INLA, we will utilize Stan through the brms R package, which provides a flexible framework for Bayesian regression modeling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. This approach will serve as a validation check for the INLA implementation and allow for more complex distributional assumptions if needed.

4.9 Model Validation and Selection

A comprehensive validation strategy will be employed to assess model performance and guide model selection. Internal validation will be conducted using cross-validation techniques, including k-fold cross-validation stratified by province and time period. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) will be implemented using the Pareto smoothed importance sampling LOO (PSIS-LOO) approach, which provides efficient computation of out-of-sample prediction accuracy.

Model comparison will utilize the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), which balance model fit and complexity. Lower values of these criteria indicate better models. Additionally, the Conditional Predictive Ordinate (CPO) will be computed for each observation, with the sum of log-CPOs serving as a measure of predictive performance.

Posterior predictive checks will be conducted to assess model adequacy. This involves generating replicated data from the posterior predictive distribution and comparing them to the observed data using suitable summary statistics. Discrepancies between observed and replicated data may indicate model misspecification.

For spatial components, specific validation techniques will include the assessment of spatial residuals for remaining autocorrelation using Moran's I statistic. For temporal components, autocorrelation function plots of residuals will be examined to detect any unmodeled temporal patterns.

External validation will be performed using data sources not included in the model fitting process, such as regional surveys or newer data releases as they become available. The model predictions will be compared with these external observations to assess out-of-sample predictive accuracy.

Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to evaluate the impact of modeling choices, including different prior specifications, alternative neighborhood structures for the spatial component, varying smoothness parameters for temporal and age effects, and different distributional assumptions for the likelihood function.

4.10 Small Area Estimation

The Bayesian hierarchical framework naturally facilitates small area estimation through the sharing of information across spatial, temporal, and demographic domains. For areas with sparse data, the model "borrows strength" from related areas, leading to more stable estimates with appropriately quantified uncertainty.

For subnational estimation at the province/territory level, the spatial random effects directly provide the area-specific components, while the fixed effects account for measured covariates. The posterior distributions of province-specific effects, combined with the fixed effects and relevant interaction terms, yield the full posterior distribution of DMFT/dmft for each province, from which point estimates (posterior means or medians) and credible intervals can be derived.

For more granular estimates at the health region level, we will extend the hierarchical structure to include nested random effects:

log(μ\_ijklm) \= α \+ X\_ijklm'β \+ S\_i \+ R\_{i,m} \+ T\_j \+ A\_k \+ G\_l \+ interaction terms \+ ε\_ijklm

where R\_{i,m} represents the random effect for health region m within province i. This effect will be modeled with a conditional autoregressive structure at the health region level, accounting for adjacency relationships between health regions.

For regions with particularly sparse data, we will implement a Fay-Herriot-type model, which combines direct estimates (where available) with model-based estimates through a precision-weighted average. This approach ensures that direct estimates contribute proportionally to their precision, with model-based estimates dominating when direct estimates are unreliable.

Population density weights will be used for aggregating estimates from smaller to larger geographic units, ensuring that more populous regions contribute proportionally more to the aggregate estimates. This approach is particularly important for demographically heterogeneous regions.

4.11 Projection Methodology

To project dental caries patterns from 2025 to 2050, we will extend the temporal process forward while accounting for the uncertainty in future trends. The Bayesian framework provides a natural way to propagate this uncertainty through the posterior predictive distribution.

For the reference scenario, which assumes a continuation of current trends, we will extend the temporal random walk process forward, generating predictions based on the estimated model parameters. For the RW2 prior used for the temporal effect, the future values T\_j for j \> J (where J is the last observed time point) will be generated as:

T\_{J+h}|T\_{J+h-1},T\_{J+h-2} \~ Normal(2T\_{J+h-1} \- T\_{J+h-2}, τ\_T^{-1})

for h \= 1, 2, ..., 25 (projecting to 2050). This approach carries forward the estimated temporal dynamics, with the precision parameter τ\_T controlling the uncertainty in the projections.

In addition to the reference scenario, we will develop alternative scenarios to capture a range of possible futures. The optimistic scenario will assume accelerated improvement in dental health, modeled by adjusting the mean of the predictive distribution:

T\_{J+h}|T\_{J+h-1},T\_{J+h-2} \~ Normal(2T\_{J+h-1} \- T\_{J+h-2} \- δ\_opt, τ\_T^{-1})

where δ\_opt is a positive value representing the accelerated improvement factor. Conversely, the pessimistic scenario will assume slowed improvement or deterioration:

T\_{J+h}|T\_{J+h-1},T\_{J+h-2} \~ Normal(2T\_{J+h-1} \- T\_{J+h-2} \+ δ\_pes, τ\_T^{-1})

where δ\_pes is a parameter controlling the degree of deterioration.

The values of δ\_opt and δ\_pes will be determined based on expert opinion and historical patterns observed in jurisdictions with improving or deteriorating dental health.

For covariates included in the model, future values will be projected using appropriate methods. Demographic projections will be based on Statistics Canada's population projections. Socioeconomic indicators will be projected using time series methods or scenario-based approaches. Healthcare system variables will be projected based on historical trends and policy scenarios. Water fluoridation coverage will be projected based on current trends and potential policy changes.

To fully account for uncertainty in the projections, we will generate multiple draws from the posterior distribution of model parameters and then, for each draw, generate projected values for each future time point. This approach captures both the uncertainty in parameter estimation and the inherent stochasticity in future trends.

4.12 Compositional Analysis of DMFT/dmft Components

Beyond modeling the overall DMFT/dmft index, we will conduct a compositional analysis to understand the relative contributions of the decayed (D/d), missing (M/m), and filled (F/f) components. This analysis provides insights into treatment patterns, access to care, and the effectiveness of preventive interventions.

For this purpose, we will employ a Bayesian compositional data model, treating the proportions (D/DMFT, M/DMFT, F/DMFT) as a compositional vector that sums to 1\. The compositional vectors will be transformed using the isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation to map them from the simplex to an unconstrained Euclidean space. In this transformed space, we will apply a similar hierarchical modeling structure as described above, with spatial, temporal, age, and sex effects.

The model for the transformed compositional vector y\_ijkl \= ilr(p\_ijkl), where p\_ijkl \= (D/DMFT, M/DMFT, F/DMFT)\_ijkl, can be specified as:

y\_ijkl \= α\_y \+ X\_ijkl'β\_y \+ S\_i^y \+ T\_j^y \+ A\_k^y \+ G\_l^y \+ interaction terms \+ ε\_ijkl^y

where the superscript y denotes parameters specific to the compositional model. The posterior distributions of these parameters will be back-transformed to the simplex to obtain estimates of the component proportions for each combination of province, year, age group, and sex.

This compositional analysis will provide valuable insights into the changing patterns of dental care and treatment across Canada, helping to identify regions with high untreated decay (high D/DMFT ratio) or differing treatment philosophies (variations in M/DMFT versus F/DMFT ratios).

4.13 Integration with Economic Models

To enhance the policy relevance of the analysis, we will integrate the dental caries estimates with economic models to assess the economic burden of dental caries and the potential cost-effectiveness of interventions. This integration will utilize the full posterior distributions of DMFT/dmft estimates to properly account for uncertainty in the economic calculations.

The economic burden will be estimated using a cost-of-illness approach, considering both direct costs (dental treatments, medications) and indirect costs (productivity losses, quality of life impacts). Treatment costs will be estimated based on provincial fee guides and utilization patterns. Productivity losses will be calculated using the human capital approach, considering workdays lost due to dental problems.

For cost-effectiveness analyses, we will model the impact of potential interventions (e.g., expanded water fluoridation, school-based preventive programs, increased public dental coverage) on future DMFT/dmft trajectories. The costs of these interventions will be estimated based on implementation expenses and ongoing operational costs. The economic benefits will be derived from the projected reductions in dental caries and associated treatment needs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated to compare the relative efficiency of different intervention strategies.

The Bayesian framework allows for a comprehensive treatment of uncertainty in these economic analyses, with probabilistic sensitivity analyses conducted by propagating the uncertainty in DMFT/dmft estimates through the economic models.

4.14 Computational Considerations and Software Implementation

The implementation of the described Bayesian hierarchical models requires substantial computational resources, particularly for models with complex random effect structures and large datasets spanning multiple provinces, years, and demographic groups. To address these computational challenges, we will employ a combination of efficient algorithms and high-performance computing resources.

The primary analysis will be conducted using the R-INLA package, which implements the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation method for Bayesian inference. INLA offers computational advantages over traditional MCMC methods for latent Gaussian models, with significantly reduced computation times while maintaining high accuracy. For the spatial components, we will utilize the SPDE (Stochastic Partial Differential Equation) approach implemented in INLA, which provides an efficient approximation to Gaussian fields with Matérn covariance, suitable for modeling spatial dependencies across irregular domains such as provincial boundaries.

For models or components not readily implementable in INLA, we will use Stan through the brms R package, which implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). This approach provides efficient exploration of the posterior distribution for complex hierarchical models, with improved convergence properties compared to traditional MCMC methods.

For parallel processing of multiple model fits (e.g., for sensitivity analyses or cross-validation), we will utilize the parallel and future packages in R, leveraging multi-core processors where available. For particularly computationally intensive tasks, we will employ high-performance computing clusters, with models distributed across nodes to reduce computation time.

All code will be version-controlled using Git, with repositories hosted on platforms such as GitHub or GitLab to facilitate collaboration and ensure reproducibility. The code will be structured in a modular fashion, with separate scripts for data preparation, model fitting, validation, visualization, and projection, linked through a master script that orchestrates the overall workflow.

The final implementation will be documented comprehensively, with detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each code component. A computational appendix will be prepared, describing the hardware, software versions, and execution times for each analysis component, to facilitate replication and extension of the work.

Despite our comprehensive data collection strategy, notable limitations exist in the available DMFT/dmft data for Canada. Historical data sparsity poses challenges, particularly for northern territories and Indigenous communities where systematic oral health surveillance has been inconsistent. Methodological heterogeneity across surveys limits direct comparability, necessitating crosswalking procedures that introduce additional uncertainty. Representativeness concerns persist, as marginalized populations including homeless individuals, recent immigrants, and those with disabilities may be systematically underrepresented in the primary data sources. Selection biases in clinic-based studies may skew estimates toward populations with better healthcare access, potentially underestimating true caries burden in underserved communities.

## **Model specification limitations**

The selected Bayesian hierarchical framework, while flexible, imposes certain structural assumptions that may not fully capture the complexity of dental caries distribution. The negative binomial distribution assumption for DMFT/dmft counts may inadequately model the excess zeros often observed in younger age groups. Our spatiotemporal model assumes stationarity in spatial correlation structures over time, which may be violated if neighboring relationships between regions evolve due to changing migration patterns or healthcare access dynamics. The separable structure for space-time interactions represents a simplification of potentially more complex interdependencies. Random walk priors for the temporal component may inadequately capture abrupt changes resulting from policy implementations or healthcare system reforms.

## **Computational and implementation challenges**

The high-dimensional parameter space necessitates substantial computational resources, potentially limiting the feasibility of more complex model specifications. INLA approximations, while computationally efficient, may insufficiently characterize multimodal posterior distributions or complex dependency structures. Convergence issues may arise for regions with extremely sparse data, necessitating stronger prior specifications that could introduce bias. The curse of dimensionality becomes particularly problematic when modeling high-order interactions, potentially necessitating dimensionality reduction approaches that sacrifice interpretability. High-performance computing infrastructure requirements may limit reproducibility for researchers with limited computational resources.

## **Projection and scenario limitations**

Projections to 2050 inherit all uncertainties from the historical model and introduce additional assumption-dependent uncertainties. Scenario-based projections necessarily simplify the complex interplay of socioeconomic, demographic, technological, and policy factors affecting future dental caries trajectories. The projection methodology assumes structural stability in the relationship between covariates and outcomes, potentially failing to capture paradigm shifts in dental care delivery or prevention strategies. Climate change impacts on population distribution and Indigenous community relocation are inadequately incorporated into long-term projections. The scenario framework may insufficiently capture the potential for non-linear responses to policy interventions or technological disruptions in oral healthcare.

## **Inference and interpretation challenges**

Ecological fallacy risks arise when interpreting province-level associations as applicable to individuals. Small area estimation for sparsely populated regions produces wider credible intervals that may limit policy utility. Compositional analysis of DMFT/dmft components faces identifiability challenges when components are highly correlated. The Bayesian framework's incorporation of prior information, while methodologically sound, introduces subjective elements that may influence conclusions. Causal inference remains limited despite the comprehensive model structure, as unmeasured confounders and reverse causality cannot be ruled out. Translation of complex model outputs into actionable policy recommendations requires careful interpretation of uncertainty that may be challenging to communicate to stakeholders without statistical expertise.
